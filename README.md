# Project Purpose:

With this project, I was provided with a working RSS feed application that needed a test suite built for it. My job was to create the test suite using Jasmine 2.0 and ensure that all tests pass.

This project demonstrates an understanding of testing using Jasmine which is essential for test-driven application development.
